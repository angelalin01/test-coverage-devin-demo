# Test Coverage Analysis - TelemetryStatusService

**Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Current Coverage:** 51% (383 statements, 186 missed)  
**Target:** 40-50% baseline for initial release

## Executive Summary

This repository represents a realistic scenario where happy-path testing achieves moderate coverage (51%) but silently misses critical failure scenarios. Six subtle bugs have been intentionally seeded into the codebase to demonstrate real-world blind spots that would go undetected without comprehensive testing. These bugs represent the types of silent failures that cause production incidents in telemetry-critical systems.

## What Current Tests Cover (Happy Path)

The existing test suite verifies basic functionality:

✅ Valid telemetry packet creation and validation  
✅ Basic packet reception and buffering  
✅ Milestone state transitions (NOT_STARTED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETE)  
✅ Progress tracking for milestones  
✅ Simple readiness computation  
✅ Receiver statistics tracking

## Seeded Silent Failure Bugs

The following bugs exist in the codebase but are **NOT caught by current tests**:

### BUG #1: Out-of-Order Packets Silently Dropped
**Location:** `ingestion/receiver.py:19-24`  
**Issue:** Reorder buffer initialized but never used; out-of-order packets within sequence gap ≤ 3 are dropped instead of buffered/reordered  
**Requirements Violated:** Out-of-order packets should be buffered and reordered if within gap threshold  
**Current Test Blind Spot:** No tests verify sequence ordering or packet reordering capability  
**Detection Requires:**
- test_out_of_order_packet_buffering()
- test_sequence_gap_within_threshold()
- test_sequence_gap_beyond_threshold_drops_packet()

### BUG #2: Retry Logic Only Attempts 2 Times Instead of 3
**Location:** `ingestion/receiver.py:62-65,69`  
**Issue:** Async retry condition uses `< 2` instead of `< 3`, stopping after 2 attempts  
**Requirements Violated:** Should retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff  
**Current Test Blind Spot:** No async failure/retry tests at all  
**Detection Requires:**
- test_async_retry_with_three_attempts()
- test_exponential_backoff_timing()
- test_async_all_retries_exhausted()

### BUG #3: Exceptions Swallowed Without Error Event
**Location:** `ingestion/receiver.py:74-79`  
**Issue:** Async exceptions caught and silently returned as False; no error event emitted  
**Requirements Violated:** Failed operations must emit error events, not crash service  
**Current Test Blind Spot:** No exception handling verification  
**Detection Requires:**
- test_async_failure_emits_error_event()
- test_callback_exception_isolation()
- test_service_continues_after_exception()

### BUG #4: Malformed Data Values Not Validated
**Location:** `ingestion/packet.py:63-67`  
**Issue:** Packet marked valid even if data contains type mismatches (string instead of float)  
**Requirements Violated:** Type validation should catch malformed metric values  
**Current Test Blind Spot:** No type correctness verification for packet data  
**Detection Requires:**
- test_validate_packet_with_type_mismatches()
- test_reject_string_where_float_expected()
- test_extreme_metric_values()

### BUG #5: Duplicate Packets Overwrite State
**Location:** `processors/milestone_processor.py:69-72`  
**Issue:** No deduplication; same packet_id can be processed multiple times, corrupting metrics  
**Requirements Violated:** Duplicate detection should prevent state corruption  
**Current Test Blind Spot:** No duplicate packet tests in processor  
**Detection Requires:**
- test_process_duplicate_packet_rejected()
- test_duplicate_packet_does_not_corrupt_metrics()
- test_packet_id_tracking_across_milestones()

### BUG #6: No Milestone Dependency Enforcement
**Location:** `status/readiness.py:89-92`  
**Issue:** Milestones can complete out of order; liftoff could be COMPLETE while engine_chill is IN_PROGRESS  
**Requirements Violated:** Launch sequence has dependencies that must be enforced  
**Current Test Blind Spot:** No dependency or ordering constraints tested  
**Detection Requires:**
- test_milestone_dependencies_enforced()
- test_liftoff_requires_all_previous_complete()
- test_cannot_skip_critical_milestones()

## Detailed Test Plan to Surface Silent Failures

### Phase 1: Critical Silent Failure Detection (Target: +20% coverage)

**Priority: CRITICAL** - These tests will expose all 6 seeded bugs

#### 1.1 Out-of-Order Packet Handling
```python
def test_out_of_order_packet_within_gap_threshold():
    """Send packets [1, 3, 2] with sequence numbers. Verify packet 2 is buffered
    and reordered since gap (3-2=1) is ≤ 3."""
    # Expected: All packets processed in order
    # Currently: Packet 2 dropped silently (BUG #1)

def test_out_of_order_packet_beyond_gap_threshold():
    """Send packets [1, 6, 2]. Gap (6-2=4) exceeds threshold."""
    # Expected: Packet 2 logged and dropped
    # Currently: Packet 2 dropped silently (might pass, needs verification)

def test_reorder_buffer_capacity():
    """Fill reorder buffer with 10 out-of-order packets."""
    # Expected: Oldest packets flushed when buffer full
    # Currently: Reorder buffer never used (BUG #1)
```

#### 1.2 Async Retry Logic
```python
def test_async_retry_exactly_three_times():
    """Mock receive_packet to always fail. Count retry attempts."""
    # Expected: 3 retry attempts (0, 1, 2)
    # Currently: Only 2 retry attempts (BUG #2)

def test_exponential_backoff_timing():
    """Verify backoff intervals: 500ms, 1000ms, 2000ms."""
    # Expected: Exponential backoff with base 500ms
    # Currently: Timing is correct, but stops early

def test_async_retry_emits_error_event_after_exhaustion():
    """After 3 failed retries, error event should be emitted."""
    # Expected: Error event emitted
    # Currently: No error event (BUG #3)
```

#### 1.3 Type Validation
```python
def test_packet_with_string_where_float_expected():
    """Create packet with {"temperature": "very cold"} instead of float."""
    # Expected: Validation fails
    # Currently: Packet marked valid (BUG #4)

def test_packet_with_extreme_values():
    """Test temperature=999999, negative sequence numbers."""
    # Expected: Range validation fails
    # Currently: No range checks (BUG #4)
```

#### 1.4 Duplicate Packet Detection
```python
def test_duplicate_packet_rejected_by_processor():
    """Process same packet_id twice. Second should be rejected."""
    # Expected: Second packet rejected, metrics unchanged
    # Currently: Both processed, metrics corrupted (BUG #5)

def test_duplicate_detection_across_milestones():
    """Same packet_id for different milestones should be allowed."""
    # Expected: Allowed (packet_id scoped per milestone)
    # Verify current behavior matches requirements
```

#### 1.5 Milestone Dependencies
```python
def test_liftoff_blocked_if_engine_chill_incomplete():
    """Mark liftoff COMPLETE while engine_chill is IN_PROGRESS."""
    # Expected: Readiness level NOT READY or HOLD
    # Currently: Readiness might show READY (BUG #6)

def test_milestone_sequence_enforcement():
    """Enforce: engine_chill → fuel_load → pressurization → terminal_count → ignition → liftoff."""
    # Expected: Out-of-sequence completion blocked
    # Currently: No enforcement (BUG #6)
```

### Phase 2: Edge Case Coverage (Target: +15% coverage)

**Priority: HIGH** - Real-world telemetry edge cases

#### 2.1 Timing Windows
```python
def test_packet_timestamp_clock_skew():
    """Packet arrives with timestamp 60ms in past (exceeds ±50ms threshold)."""
    # Verify clock skew detection and handling

def test_rapid_state_transitions():
    """Milestone goes NOT_STARTED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETE in < 100ms."""
    # Verify all transitions recorded correctly

def test_stale_data_handling():
    """Old packet (timestamp 1 hour ago) arrives after milestone already complete."""
    # Should be rejected as stale
```

#### 2.2 Concurrent Operations
```python
def test_concurrent_packet_processing():
    """Send 100 async packets for same milestone simultaneously."""
    # Verify no race conditions in state updates

def test_buffer_overflow_under_concurrent_load():
    """Flood receiver with 10,000 packets/sec."""
    # Verify graceful degradation when buffer full
```

#### 2.3 StatusAggregator (28% → 80%)
```python
def test_snapshot_capture_and_retrieval():
    """Capture snapshots, retrieve historical data."""

def test_retention_policy_24_hour_boundary():
    """Verify snapshots exactly at 24-hour mark are handled correctly."""

def test_completion_timeline_generation():
    """Generate timeline showing when each milestone completed."""
```

### Phase 3: Robustness & Performance (Target: +10% coverage)

**Priority: MEDIUM** - Production reliability

#### 3.1 Fault Injection
```python
def test_callback_exception_does_not_crash_receiver():
    """Register callback that raises exception. Verify receiver continues."""
    # Relates to BUG #3

def test_malformed_json_in_packet_data():
    """Packet data contains unparseable JSON structures."""

def test_memory_usage_under_sustained_load():
    """Process packets continuously for 5 minutes. Monitor memory."""
```

#### 3.2 API Layer (0% → 40%)
```python
def test_api_submit_packet_endpoint():
    """POST valid packet to /packets."""

def test_api_invalid_packet_returns_400():
    """POST malformed packet, expect HTTP 400."""

def test_api_readiness_endpoint():
    """GET /readiness, verify response format."""
```

### Phase 4: State Machine Coverage (37% → 70%)

**Priority: LOW** - Generic component with limited launch-specific logic

```python
def test_state_machine_transition_callbacks():
    """Verify callbacks invoked on state transitions."""

def test_state_machine_invalid_transition_rejected():
    """Attempt disallowed transition."""
```

## Coverage Progression Roadmap

| Phase | Focus | Bugs Exposed | Target Coverage | Estimated Tests |
|-------|-------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Current** | Happy path only | 0/6 | 51% | 15 tests |
| **Phase 1** | Silent failures | 6/6 | 71% | +18 tests |
| **Phase 2** | Edge cases | - | 86% | +12 tests |
| **Phase 3** | Robustness | - | 96% | +8 tests |
| **Phase 4** | Completeness | - | 100% | +5 tests |

## Test Effectiveness Matrix

| Bug | Severity | Production Impact | Detection Difficulty | Phase 1 Test |
|-----|----------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| #1 Out-of-order | **CRITICAL** | Lost telemetry data, incorrect state | HARD | test_out_of_order_packet_within_gap_threshold |
| #2 Retry 2x not 3x | **HIGH** | Increased error rate, SLA violations | MEDIUM | test_async_retry_exactly_three_times |
| #3 Swallowed exceptions | **CRITICAL** | Silent failures, no alerting | HARD | test_async_retry_emits_error_event_after_exhaustion |
| #4 Type validation | **HIGH** | State corruption from bad data | EASY | test_packet_with_string_where_float_expected |
| #5 Duplicate processing | **CRITICAL** | Metrics corruption, incorrect readiness | MEDIUM | test_duplicate_packet_rejected_by_processor |
| #6 No dependencies | **CRITICAL** | False launch readiness, safety violation | HARD | test_liftoff_blocked_if_engine_chill_incomplete |

## Recommendations

### Before Deployment
1. **Immediately implement Phase 1 tests** - These expose all critical seeded bugs
2. **Fix all 6 bugs** before considering production deployment
3. **Achieve minimum 85% coverage** with focus on failure paths

### Testing Philosophy
This repository demonstrates why **numerical coverage is not enough**. At 51% coverage with happy-path tests, the service appears functional but contains 6 critical bugs that would cause:
- Silent data loss (Bug #1)
- Incorrect reliability metrics (Bug #2)
- Undetected failures (Bug #3)
- State corruption (Bugs #4, #5)
- Safety violations (Bug #6)

**True confidence requires:**
- Failure scenario testing
- Edge case verification
- Concurrent operation validation
- Type safety enforcement
- Dependency constraint testing

### Questions for Product Owner

Before proceeding to 100% coverage:

1. **Milestone Dependencies**: Should we enforce strict ordering (engine_chill before liftoff) or allow parallel completion?
2. **Retry Exhaustion**: After 3 retries fail, should we:
   - Block further packets for that milestone?
   - Continue processing but log persistent errors?
   - Trigger manual intervention alert?
3. **Clock Skew**: What's acceptable for cross-station synchronization? Current spec says ±50ms.
4. **Performance**: What's the target packet rate and buffer size for production load?
5. **Out-of-Order Tolerance**: Is gap threshold of 3 correct, or should it be configurable?

## Conclusion

This codebase represents a realistic "developer handoff" scenario where initial implementation achieves moderate coverage (51%) but misses critical edge cases. The 6 seeded bugs demonstrate how happy-path testing creates false confidence. Achieving true 100% confidence requires systematic testing of failure modes, not just happy paths.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review seeded bugs with team
2. Implement Phase 1 tests to expose silent failures
3. Fix discovered bugs
4. Continue with Phase 2-4 tests for comprehensive coverage
