# Test Coverage Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Overall Coverage:** 84% (373 statements, 61 missed)

## Executive Summary

The initial test suite successfully achieves 84% code coverage, significantly exceeding the target baseline of 40-50%. The tests comprehensively cover happy-path logic across all modules, with particular strength in the ingestion layer (94-98%) and status computation (100%). However, several critical gaps remain in edge-case handling, asynchronous operations, and failure recovery paths.

## Critical Coverage Gaps Requiring Attention

### Priority 1: High-Risk, High-Impact

1. **StatusAggregator (35% coverage)**
   - **Issue:** Historical data management completely untested
   - **Impact:** Post-launch analysis and debugging capabilities compromised
   - **Complexity:** HIGH - involves time-based logic, data retention, and edge cases
   - **Test Scenarios Needed:**
     - Snapshot capture under high-frequency updates
     - Retention policy behavior at boundaries (exactly 24 hours)
     - Retrieval of snapshots near retention cutoff
     - Handling of missing milestones in historical data
     - Memory usage with large snapshot history
     - Time zone and timestamp precision issues

2. **Callback Error Handling (Multiple Modules)**
   - **Issue:** No tests for callback exceptions in receiver and state machine
   - **Impact:** Silent failures or cascading errors if callbacks fail
   - **Complexity:** MEDIUM - requires exception injection and isolation testing
   - **Test Scenarios Needed:**
     - Callback raises exception during packet reception
     - Multiple callbacks, one fails, others continue
     - Callback modifies state unexpectedly
     - Long-running callback blocks processing

3. **API HTTP Error Paths (api/server.py)**
   - **Issue:** HTTP error responses untested due to TestClient incompatibility
   - **Impact:** Dashboard may receive unexpected responses during failures
   - **Complexity:** LOW - primarily configuration issue
   - **Test Scenarios Needed:**
     - Invalid packet submission (malformed data)
     - Non-existent milestone queries
     - Invalid timestamp formats
     - Oversized packet payloads

### Priority 2: Edge Cases and Failure Modes

4. **Asynchronous Operations**
   - **Issue:** Limited testing of async behavior under concurrent load
   - **Complexity:** HIGH - requires orchestration of timing and concurrency
   - **Test Scenarios Needed:**
     - **Race conditions:** Multiple packets for same milestone arriving simultaneously
     - **Timeout handling:** Long-running async operations
     - **Retry logic:** Failed async operations and recovery
     - **Backpressure:** Receiver buffer full during high-frequency async writes

5. **Out-of-Order and Malformed Data**
   - **Issue:** Limited testing of real-world telemetry issues
   - **Complexity:** MEDIUM - requires domain knowledge of telemetry systems
   - **Test Scenarios Needed:**
     - **Sequence gaps:** Packets 1, 2, 5, 3, 4 (gap + out-of-order)
     - **Time travel:** Packet with timestamp in the past arriving after newer data
     - **Duplicate sequence numbers:** Two packets with same sequence but different data
     - **Missing required fields:** Packets missing critical data fields
     - **Type mismatches:** String values where floats expected
     - **Extreme values:** Temperature = 999999, negative sequence numbers

6. **Timing-Sensitive Windows**
   - **Issue:** No tests for time-dependent logic behavior
   - **Complexity:** HIGH - requires time mocking and careful orchestration
   - **Test Scenarios Needed:**
     - **Retention boundary:** Snapshot exactly at 24-hour mark
     - **Rapid state changes:** Milestone goes NOT_STARTED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETE in milliseconds
     - **Stale data detection:** Old packet arrives after milestone already completed
     - **Clock skew:** Packets from different ground stations with time drift

### Priority 3: Performance and Scale

7. **High-Volume Scenarios**
   - **Issue:** No load/stress testing
   - **Complexity:** MEDIUM - requires performance testing infrastructure
   - **Test Scenarios Needed:**
     - 10,000 packets per second ingestion
     - Buffer behavior at capacity (10,000+ packets)
     - Memory usage over extended runs
     - Aggregator performance with 1000+ snapshots

8. **State Machine Complexity**
   - **Issue:** Limited testing of complex transition graphs
   - **Complexity:** MEDIUM - combinatorial explosion of states
   - **Test Scenarios Needed:**
     - Cyclic transitions (if allowed)
     - Multi-step transition sequences
     - Concurrent state machines for different milestones
     - State machine with 100+ states and transitions

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Attempting 100% Coverage)

1. **Fix TestClient compatibility** - Upgrade httpx/starlette versions or use alternative HTTP testing approach
2. **Add comprehensive StatusAggregator tests** - This is the largest gap and highest risk
3. **Implement callback error handling tests** - Critical for production reliability
4. **Add timing mocks** - Use `freezegun` or similar to test time-dependent logic

### Clarification Questions for Product Owner

Before proceeding to close all coverage gaps, please clarify:

1. **Asynchronous retry logic requirements:**
   - Should failed async operations automatically retry?
   - What is the expected retry policy (exponential backoff, max attempts)?
   - How should the system behave during prolonged receiver unavailability?

2. **Out-of-order packet handling:**
   - Should out-of-order packets be rejected, buffered, or reordered?
   - What is the acceptable sequence gap before considering packets lost?
   - Should we maintain a reordering buffer? If so, what size?

3. **Error recovery and fault tolerance:**
   - If a critical milestone fails, can it be reset and retried?
   - Should the system support "manual override" of milestone states?
   - What happens if telemetry stops arriving mid-launch?

4. **Performance requirements:**
   - What is the expected packet rate (packets/second)?
   - How long should historical data be retained (currently 24 hours)?
   - What are the memory constraints for the receiver buffer?

5. **Time synchronization:**
   - Are all ground stations synchronized to a common time source?
   - What is the acceptable clock skew between stations?
   - Should timestamps be validated against a reasonable range?

## Testing Strategy for Remaining Gaps

### Phase 1: Complete Core Coverage (Target: 95%)
- StatusAggregator full test coverage
- API HTTP endpoint testing (fix TestClient issue)
- Callback error handling tests
- Edge cases in existing modules

### Phase 2: Asynchronous & Timing (Target: 98%)
- Concurrent packet processing
- Race condition testing
- Timeout and retry logic
- Time-dependent behavior with mocking

### Phase 3: Fault Injection & Resilience (Target: 100%)
- Malformed data handling
- Out-of-order packets
- Extreme timing windows
- System recovery scenarios

## Conclusion

The initial 84% coverage provides a solid foundation for happy-path testing. The service correctly handles normal telemetry processing, milestone tracking, and readiness computation. However, achieving the required 100% coverage for production deployment will require significant additional effort focused on edge cases, failure modes, and asynchronous behavior. The identified gaps represent real-world scenarios that must be tested before this system can be trusted for actual launch operations.
